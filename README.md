## Introduction

Perfect hashing is a special hash function that ensures a collision-free mapping of ùëõ keys into ùëö consecutive natural numbers, which enables the creation of a perfect hashing table where each unique key occupies a distinct slot. With its minimal lookup bandwidth and small, constant lookup time, perfect hashing can be a powerful tool for remote memory data storage. Existing dynamic perfect hashing attains high load factor at the expense of sacrificing associativity. This paper proposes an extensible dynamic perfect hashing for remote memory KV storage, called CuckooDuo, whose key design is two interlinked cuckoo hash tables. CuckooDuo has the associativity of exact one, and it achieves high load factor, fast speed, and minimal communication bandwidth simultaneously, as well as supports efficient expansion without subtable rebuilding. We theoretically analyze the probability of insertion failure in CuckooDuo. We fully implement CuckooDuo in a testbed built with two servers and one switch interconnected via RDMA networks. Extensive experimental results show that CuckooDuo achieves up to 125x smaller communication overhead and 2.3x faster speed than prior art. All related codes are open-sourced.
