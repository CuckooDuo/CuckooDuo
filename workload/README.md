# YCSB Workloads

## Overview

We use YCSB [[1]](#md-ref-1) to generate workloads to conduct experiments. We use the default Zipfian request distribution (ùúÉ = 0.99) for all workloads. For most experiments in our paper, we first load a YCSB workload with 30M insert requests into the KV table, and then perform lookup/update/delete operations on the inserted items. For the experiments on hybrid workloads (Figure 11), we first load 3M items into the KV table, and then test the performance of all algorithms under nine YCSB workloads with different insert/update ratio (from 1:9 to 9:1). 

All the YCSB workloads used in our paper can be found in the following [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y2WI6RYiPiWq6lNlhOusQbZMW1n89sBC/view?usp=share_link). 

In this folder, we also provide 19 small sample workloads containing 64K requests with suffix `-64K`. These small workloads can be directly used to run the codes in this project by modfying file path in cpp files.

- `load-64K.txt` contains 64K insert requests, which can be used to conduct most experiments in our paper. 

- `run_xx-64K.txt` contains 6.4K (10%) hybrid requests with different insert/query ratios respectively, which can be used to run the experiments on hybrid workloads (Figure 5 in Supplementary Materials).

- 'run_workloada_xx-64K.txt` and `run_workloadd_xx-64K.txt` contain requests generated by YCSB-A and YCSB-D workloads with 4 distributions (zipf-0.99, zipf-0.90, latest, uniform), which can be used to run the experiments on different workloads and distributions (Table ‚Ö¢).

- `run_18M_zipf-64K.txt` contains a small-scale version whose table slots is 64K for 'run_18M_zipf.txt' used in gerneral 30M slots version, which can be used to run the query experiment with cache (Figure 11(c)).

Note that when using small workloads, we should reduce the stash size of TEA to acquire similar speed results in our paper.
